# My neovim configuration

### Introduction

A starting point for my personal neovim configuration. This is based on the [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

Distribution Alternatives:
- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/): A delightful distribution maintained by @folke (the author of lazy.nvim, the package manager used here)

### Installation

Install Nvim from source. I am on Ubuntu WSL, you can also install neovim from the snap package.

```
rm -rf  .local/share/nvim/lazy
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_0

sudo apt-get install ninja-build gettext cmake unzip curl

<!-- https://github.com/sadikeey/nvim -->

git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
cd neovim
git branch -a
git checkout release-0.9
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
sudo make install

```

* run: `git clone https://github.com/mailman-2097/kickstart.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim`
* Run Neovim (from terminal or shortcut) and allow lazy.nvim to download files and set up the basics.
* Once the setup is complete, restart Neovim.
* **You're ready to go!**

Additional system requirements:
- Make sure to review the readmes of the plugins if you are experiencing errors. In particular:
  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) is required for multiple [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#suggested-dependencies) pickers.
- See [Windows Installation](#Windows-Installation) if you have trouble with `telescope-fzf-native`

### Configuration And Extension

* Inside of your copy, feel free to modify any file you like! It's your copy!
* Feel free to change any of the default options in `init.lua` to better suit your needs.
* For adding plugins, there are 3 primary options:
  * Add new configuration in `lua/custom/plugins/*` files, which will be auto sourced using `lazy.nvim` (uncomment the line importing the `custom/plugins` directory in the `init.lua` file to enable this)
  * Modify `init.lua` with additional plugins.
  * Include the `lua/kickstart/plugins/*` files in your configuration.

You can also merge updates/changes from the repo back into your fork, to keep up-to-date with any changes for the default configuration.

#### Example: Adding an autopairs plugin

In the file: `lua/custom/plugins/autopairs.lua`, add:

```lua
-- File: lua/custom/plugins/autopairs.lua

return {
  "windwp/nvim-autopairs",
  -- Optional dependency
  dependencies = { 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp' },
  config = function()
    require("nvim-autopairs").setup {}
    -- If you want to automatically add `(` after selecting a function or method
    local cmp_autopairs = require('nvim-autopairs.completion.cmp')
    local cmp = require('cmp')
    cmp.event:on(
      'confirm_done',
      cmp_autopairs.on_confirm_done()
    )
  end,
}
```


This will automatically install [windwp/nvim-autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs) and enable it on startup. For more information, see documentation for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

#### Example: Adding a file tree plugin

In the file: `lua/custom/plugins/filetree.lua`, add:

```lua
-- Unless you are still migrating, remove the deprecated commands from v1.x
vim.cmd([[ let g:neo_tree_remove_legacy_commands = 1 ]])

return {
  "nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim",
  version = "*",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- not strictly required, but recommended
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
  },
  config = function ()
    require('neo-tree').setup {}
  end,
}
```

This will install the tree plugin and add the command `:Neotree` for you. You can explore the documentation at [neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim) for more information.

### Contribution

Pull-requests are not welcome. You are better off, forking the upstream or using a custom nvim distribution.

* Custom language server configuration (null-ls templates)
* Theming beyond a default colorscheme necessary for LSP highlight groups

Each PR, especially those which increase the line count, should have a description as to why the PR is necessary.

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up, then delete all files associated with it.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the neovim files in `~/.local` which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
  * You may also want to look at the [migration guide for lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-migration-guide)
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-uninstalling) information
* Are there any cool videos about this plugin?
  * Current iteration of kickstart (coming soon)
  * Here is one about the previous iteration of kickstart: [video introduction to Kickstart.nvim](https://youtu.be/stqUbv-5u2s). Note the install via init.lua no longer works as specified. Please follow the install instructions in this file instead as they're up to date.

### Windows Installation

Installation may require installing build tools, and updating the run command for `telescope-fzf-native`

See `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

This requires:

- Install CMake, and the Microsoft C++ Build Tools on Windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```
